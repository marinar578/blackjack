# PROJECT 1: BLACKJACK

### Blackjack

Play BlackJack, the most widely played casino banking game in the world!!

> Also known as twenty-one,  Blackjack is a comparing card game between a player and dealer, meaning players compete against the dealer but not against other players. It is played with a deck of 52 cards.

#### How to Win:

You can win a round of Blackjack in the following ways:
- Reach 21 points (as long as the dealer has fewer points than you)
- Have more points in your hand than the dealer without exceeding 21
- If the dealer busts and goes over 21 points in a round

#### Point Values:
- Each numbered card is worth as many points as its number
- Each face card (King, Queen, and Jack) is worth 10 points
- Ace is worth 1 or 11, depending on the player's choice in the context of her hand

#### Hit or Stand:
- The dealer and the player are dealt two initial cards
- The player has a choice to hit or stand. The player will be dealt a new card each time he or she "hits". The goal is to get as close to 21 points without going over (or, ideally, to get to 21 points!)
- If the player is satisfied with his or her hand, the player can choose to stand. At this point, the dealer is dealt a card until he or she reaches 17 points.
- If neither bust (exceed 21), the dealer and the player compare points to determine the winner of the round.

#### In this Verison:
- choose to hit or stand until you reach 21 points! 
- your points and the dealer's points are revealed at the end of each round, on the bottom-left corner of the screen.
- try to get more wins than the dealer! Wins and ties can be seen on the bottom-right corner at the end of each round.

#### Additional Features to Come!

I hope to improve the game in the future with a few new features:

- animating card flips and dealt cards
- adding sound effects along with the animations
- adding betting options and keeping track of bets based on table odds
- allowing multiple users to play simultaneously against one another
